Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, this study has successfully implemented and evaluated the Chandra-Toueg consensus algorithm across various scenarios on the AHCv2 platform. The findings illustrate that while the algorithm performs effectively under conditions with a reliable failure detector, its performance is inherently tied to the detector's accuracy. This research underscores the importance of selecting appropriate consensus algorithms based on the operational context and availability of robust failure detection mechanisms. Future work could explore the integration of adaptive failure detection techniques that enhance the resilience and accuracy of the consensus process, particularly in more unpredictable network environments. Further comparative analyses with detector-independent algorithms could also provide deeper insights into optimizing consensus mechanisms for a broader range of applications.
