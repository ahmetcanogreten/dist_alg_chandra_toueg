In a distributed system, where processes potentially live on different computers, some processes may crash at any point. At that point, the system must correctly identify those faulty processes and isolate them so that they will not cause further harm to the system itself. Since processes are partitioned across the network, resolving this distinction may not always be trivial. This is where failure detector algorithms come in. That is, they help correct processes identify incorrect, faulty processes in a distributed environment. One of the algorithms is the Chandra Toueg Algorithm which is actually designed by failure detector pioneers Chandra and Toueg. In this study I will implement the Chandra-Toueg Algorithm on the AHCv2 platform to test how well it works under different challenging conditions, such as crashes, delays in communication, and changes in the network structure. I want to see if the algorithm could still help correct processes to identify faulty processes, keep everything running smoothly, and recover quickly from any problems.
